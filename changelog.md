## Changes made to my website
- Previous website was not really a portfolio website, I added portfolio homepage and changed the image gallery to be an experiments page
- Homepage contains resume items of github projects I have worked on
- Contents of the homepage projects replicate the implementations used in the "Grid experiment tab"

## 3rd Party JavaScript Add-On: 
- Added Google Analytics onto my website in order to see which pages are visited the most and whether or not my linked projects are actually being visited by people who visit the site
